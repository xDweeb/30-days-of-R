# 30 Days of R Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Days of R** challenge! This repository documents my journey as I learn and master the **R programming language** over the course of 30 days. The challenge focuses on developing skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical techniques using R.

## 🔥 Challenge Objective
The goal is to gain proficiency in R within 30 days or less by following a structured learning path and working with real-world datasets. Each day, I will explore new concepts, document my progress, and share the code and projects here.

## 📅 Daily Progress
- **Day 1-5**: Basic syntax, data structures, and control flow.
- **Day 6-10**: Data manipulation with libraries like `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
- **Day 11-15**: Data visualization with `ggplot2` and `plotly`.
- **Day 16-20**: Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
- **Day 21-25**: Working with real-world datasets and completing projects.
- **Day 26-30**: Exploring advanced topics like machine learning and time series analysis (optional).

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── Day_01_to_05/          # Basics of R Programming
├── Day_06_to_10/          # Data Manipulation
├── Day_11_to_15/          # Data Visualization
├── Day_16_to_20/          # Statistical Analysis
├── Day_21_to_25/          # Real-world Projects
└── Day_26_to_30/          # Advanced Topics
```

## 💻 Tools & Libraries
Here are some of the key tools and libraries I'll be using:
- **RStudio**: IDE for R programming.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of packages like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyr` for data manipulation and visualization.
- **plotly**: For creating interactive plots.
- **caret**: For machine learning tasks.
- **forecast**: For time series analysis.
